# DRiCalendar
A calendar for recovering addicts who are trying to track their sobriety journey. 

**Purpose**

The Sobriety Tracker Calendar was created to support individuals in their daily struggle with addiction. It serves as a personal tool to help users log their sobriety status, journal their thoughts, and track symptoms day by day. Addiction is a pervasive issue in our society, and it often feels like an invisible battle. With this calendar, we hope to provide a sense of accountability and support, helping users in their journey towards sobriety.

**Background**

Addiction is a serious and widespread issue in America. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, millions of Americans struggle with substance abuse, and the opioid crisis has only exacerbated this problem. By providing a simple yet effective tool, we aim to contribute to the efforts to combat addiction and offer a resource for those in need.

**Features**

- **Daily Sobriety Logging**: Users can log their sobriety status (sober or not sober) for each day.
- **Journaling**: Each day allows users to journal their thoughts and symptoms, providing a space for self-reflection and tracking progress.
- **Visual Indicators**: The calendar highlights sober days in green and not sober days in yellow, offering a clear visual representation of progress.
- **Journal Entries Page**: Users can view all their journal entries in one place, making it easy to review past thoughts and symptoms.
- **Homepage Navigation**: The application includes a homepage with easy navigation to the calendar and journal entries.
